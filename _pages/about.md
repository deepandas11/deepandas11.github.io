Welcome to my Personal Website.

I am a graduate student at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/).
 I work with [Prof. Sharon Li](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/) and usually find myself probing on topics like:

- Continual Learning and Robustness in Deep Learning 
- Machine Learning Pipelines and Systems


You can find my technical blogposts [here](https://deepandas11.github.io/year-archive/).

When I am not invested in my academic pursuits, I am probably busy [with this.](https://deepandas11.github.io/beyond/)


Highlights:
- Aug, 2020: Wrapped up my internship at [Datachat](https://www.datachat.ai) as a Data Scientist. At Datachat, I am involved in the development of natural language prompted Machine Learning pipelines that reduce the technical barrier to perform ML and analytics workflows.
- Sep 2020: Joined as a Teaching Assistant for the Course [CS/ECE 533: Digital Image Processing]() at UW Madison. 
- June, 2020: Paper titled ['An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Data Augmentation on Distillation'](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/udl2020/accepted-papers/UDL2020-paper-082.pdf) published at ICML 2020-UDL workshop.
- Dec, 2019: Wrapped up my internship at [Scortex](https://scortex.io/) as a Deep Learning Researcher.  At Scortex, I primarily contributed to improving the existing Vision based Defect detection system. I was successful in developing an effective Active Learning strategy for the underlying Deep Learning models.
- Jan 2019: Joined as a Teaching Assistant for the Course [CS-301: Data Programming](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/spring19/syllabus.html) at UW Madison. 
- Sep. 2020: Joined the deep learning research group led by [Dr. Sharon Li](https://yixuanli.net).
- Dec, 2018: Paper titled [ Unsupervised Anomalous Trajectory Detection for Crowded Scenes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8721320/metrics#metrics) published at the 13th IEEE ICIIS conference.  
- May, 2018: Graduated from [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) with a major in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.
