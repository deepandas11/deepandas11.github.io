Welcome to my Personal Website.

I am a graduate student at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/), with interests in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am currently working on multimodal architectures for various Vision-Language tasks.

I graduated from [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) in 2018 with a major in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. 

When I am not invested in my academic pursuits, I am probably busy [with this.](https://deepandas11.github.io/beyond/)
