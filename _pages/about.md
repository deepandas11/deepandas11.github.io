Welcome to my Personal Website.

I am a graduate student at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/). I usually find myself probing on topics like:

- Multimodal Learning
- Semi-supervised methodologies 
- Incremental Learning techniques

You can find my technical blogposts [here](https://deepandas11.github.io/year-archive/)

I revently wrapped up a wonderful research internship at [Scortex](https://scortex.io/) as a Machine Learning Research Intern. I primarily contributed in areas like Active Learning and and design of Mentoring Strategies. Previously, I have been a Teaching Assistant for the Course [CS-301: Data Programming](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/spring19/syllabus.html) at the Dept. of Computer Sciences, UW Madison. I graduated from [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) in 2018 with a major in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. 

When I am not invested in my academic pursuits, I am probably busy [with this.](https://deepandas11.github.io/beyond/)
