Welcome to my Personal Website.

I am a graduate student at [The University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/).
 I work with [Prof. Sharon Li](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/) and usually find myself probing on topics like:

- Continual Learning
- Robustness in Deep Learning 
- Machine Learning Pipelines and Data Management Systems

I have had the fortune of working as a Data Scientist Intern at companies like [Datachat](https://www.datachat.ai) and 
[Scortex](https://scortex.io/). At Datachat, I am involved in the development of natural language prompted Machine Learning 
pipelines that reduce the technical barrier to perform ML and analytics workflows. At Scortex, I primarily 
primarily contributed to improving the existing Vision based Defect detection system. I was successful
 in developing an effective Active Learning strategy for the underlying Deep Learning models.
 

Previously, I have been a Teaching Assistant for the Course [CS-301: Data Programming](https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/cs301/spring19/syllabus.html) at the Dept. of Computer Sciences, UW Madison. I graduated from [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/) in 2018 with a major in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.

When I am not invested in my academic pursuits, I am probably busy [with this.](https://deepandas11.github.io/beyond/)
