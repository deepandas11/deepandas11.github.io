This is mostly a compilation of some of the mose crucial concepts that I grasped while studying rapidly about the said topic. I stumbled upon this while doing a project of my own. The way I look at it, Python invloves a few characters in this Memory management scheme: The first and the most obvious one being *

## Checking usage of kramdown.
### Also checking usage of MathJax

In this section we will check Code bit



```python
import numpy as np 

a = np.ndarray([1,2,3])


print(a)
```


### Next

In this section, we will check both inline \\( a = x^2 + y^2 \\) and block Latex Equations using MathJax

\\[ b = x^2 + y^2 \\]

\\[ b = \frac{1}{n^2}\\]

We are done!
